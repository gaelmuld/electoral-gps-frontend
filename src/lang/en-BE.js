The matching score is only one element to take into account when picking a candidate to vote for. We encourage you also jude the candidate's projects, skills and integrity. You can visit the profile of the candidate by clicking on his name.\nAlso take into account that your municipality faces challenges that are unique to it and that are not included in this tool.\nWith your support, we hope to help you even better in the federal, regional and European elections of May 2019.",
